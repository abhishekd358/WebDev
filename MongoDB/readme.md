# Types Of NoSql Databses:

```
✔ NoSQL databases are divided into 4 main types based on data model & use case.

✔ 1) Document-Based (MongoDB)
   - Data stored as JSON/BSON documents
   - Flexible schema, nested objects, arrays
   - BEST for MERN stack, web apps, APIs

✔ 2) Key-Value (Redis)
   - Data = key → value
   - Extremely fast
   - Used for caching, sessions, OTPs
   - Not suitable for complex queries

✔ 3) Column-Based (Cassandra)
   - Data stored in columns (not rows)
   - Handles huge data & high write load
   - Used in analytics, big data, IoT

✔ 4) Graph Database (Neo4j)
   - Data stored as nodes & relationships
   - Best for relationship-heavy data
   - Used in social networks, recommendations, fraud detection

✔ MongoDB is preferred for MERN because:
   - JSON-like structure (JS friendly)
   - Flexible schema
   - Easy integration with Node & React
   - Scales well

✔ Interview Line:
   "MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database ideal for scalable web applications."
