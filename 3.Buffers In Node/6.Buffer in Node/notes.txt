Buffer not availble in browser
Buffer only Node js base
Buffer is also ArrayBuffer


node Buffer is based on Typed Array Only based on:--> (Unit8Array)


Buffers created from raw data (Buffer.from([...])) use the Node.js internal buffer pool (8192 bytes).
Therefore, buffer.buffer.byteLength = 8192 even if actual buffer size is small.




b.byteLength  
→ shows how many bytes THIS buffer holds  
→ your usable size

b.buffer.byteLength  
→ shows the size of the underlying ArrayBuffer  
→ often 8192 because Node uses a memory pool (slab)
