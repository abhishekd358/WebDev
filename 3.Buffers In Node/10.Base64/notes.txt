Base64 is a character encoding that takes binary data and converts it to string/text. 
	It has total 64 characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, /, +).
	It use 6 bits only, and called as the subset of ASCII
	In browser we have few methods, 
		atob() ASCII to Binary
		btoa() Binary to ASCII
	This methods are limited, we can only pass string not actual binary data.
	It converts the given string to binary(utf-8) and binary to base64 and vice versa for other method.
	For base64 to work it need atleast 3 Byte of data, else it will add multiple zeros to fill the gap. And zeros Byte(8 Bit) will be replaced by =


	Here is **the BEST notebook-friendly explanation** of **Base64 encoding steps**, with **very short, clean steps** and **an example for the letter `"a"`**.


1. Convert character → ASCII
2. Convert ASCII → 8-bit binary
3. Pad binary to 24 bits
4. Split 24 bits → 4 groups of 6 bits
5. Convert each 6-bit group → decimal
6. Map decimal → Base64 table
7. Add padding `=` if input < 3 bytes

   * 1 byte → `==`
   * 2 bytes → `=`

### **Example: "a"**

* ASCII: 97
* Binary: `01100001`
* Padded 24 bits: `01100001 00000000 00000000`
* Groups: `011000 010000 000000 000000`
* Decimal: `24 16 0 0`
* Base64: `YQ==`
